# MATE (MUI Accelerator Table Englishizer)

### Enables English keyboard shortcuts for Explorer, Notepad and Wordpad on Windows 10 and 11 for non-English users.

------------------

## 👋 Introduction

**MATE** is a command-line utility designed to revert localized keyboard shortcut tables on specific MUI files to their original English defaults. 

In localized Windows environments, keyboard shortcuts in core applications like Explorer, Notepad and Wordpad are modified, often causing workflow friction for users who prefer standard English keyboard shortcuts such as `Ctrl + A` to select all. This utility automates the restoration of English accelerator tables into your system's MUI files, specifically targeting these three mentioned components.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, **MATE** supports only Spanish (Spain) MUI files (es-ES). If your Windows environment uses a different language, running this application will simply have no effect.

## 👌 Features

*   **Targeted Restoration**: Automatically identifies and applies native English accelerator tables to `shell32.dll.mui` (affecting Windows Explorer), `notepad.exe.mui` and `wordpad.exe.mui` files.
*   **Safety-First Design**: Utilizes CRC-32 checksum verification to ensure only known, compatible MUI files are modified.
*   **Non-Destructive Process**: Employs a temporary staging area and native Windows mechanisms for pending file rename operations after a system reboot, ensuring the original files are never directly modified while the application is running.
*   **Supports both Windows 10 and 11**: Fully tested on Windows 10 20H2 and 22H2, and Windows 11 25H2, supporting both x86 and x64 architectures.
*   **Supports Classic Wordpad on Windows 11**: Fully tested for the **WinAero**'s classic version of Wordpad on Windows 11. [Read more at Winaero](https://winaero.com/wordpad-for-windows-11/)

## ❓ FAQ

### Which Windows versions are supported?
Currently, this tool is designed for **Windows 10 and 11**. It specifically supports Windows 10 20H2 and 22H2, and Windows 11 25H2, supporting both x86 and x64 architectures.

### Which system languages are supported?
Currently, this tool supports only 'es-ES' (Spanish - Spain) MUI files, meaning that MUI files in other localizations will not be modified during program execution.

### Is it safe to use?
Yes, it is highly safe. The program operates using strict CRC-32 checksum validation; if an MUI file does not match the known signatures in the source code, it is completely ignored and remains untouched. Furthermore, the original system files are never directly modified during the program's execution. All replacements are scheduled via the Windows Session Manager to occur during the next system reboot, acting as a safe buffer.

### What should I do if I want to cancel the pending MUI file replacements or if something goes wrong?
If you need to cancel a pending MUI file replacement operation or if an issue occurs, you can manually clear the scheduled tasks:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and hit Enter.
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`.
3. Locate the value named **`PendingFileRenameOperations`**.
4. Right-click and delete this value.
   * **Warning:** Ensure that you only delete this value if you are certain it does not contain other critical scheduled file operations added by the operating system or other third party software.
   Deleting this value safely discards the pending MUI file replacement operations, ensuring no modifications are applied to your system on the next reboot.

### I am a developer and want to add support for other languages. Where should I start?
Adding support for another system language is simple. You just need to follow the existing structure:
1. Create a new class following the `LanguageConfiguration_esES` pattern (e.g., `LanguageConfiguration_ruRU` for Russian, or `LanguageConfiguration_frFR` for french).
2. Add the required resource definitions for your target language's accelerator tables in the `AccTables.vb` file.
3. Register your new language configuration in the main application logic within the `LangConfigs` array, so it can be detected during the file validation process.

Since the architecture is modular, you only need to provide the correct checksums and accelerator data for your specific localization, and the tool will handle the rest.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:

This software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind. The author is not responsible for any system instability, data loss, or operating system malfunctions. By running this application, you acknowledge that you have the knowledge to troubleshoot system-level errors and have taken the necessary precautions (e.g., creating a System Restore point or a full backup).

**Use this software at your own risk.** This application modifies system-level MUI files to change keyboard accelerator tables. While the process is designed with safety mechanisms, modifying system files always may carry issues with System File Protection (SFC), DISM, or Windows Update functionalities.
